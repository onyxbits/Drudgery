Drudge Quest is a simple memory game where the objective of the game is to
avoid running into your boss while walking down the long and confusing 
'Escher Hallway' of your company's office building.

How to play
-----------
Your real time workday is divided up into rounds of five minutes each. Every
round, you must hide from your boss in one of the rooms flanking the
hallway.
Your boss is a dreadful person, who loves to ambush you in order to give 
tedious tasks. Whenever you sneak into a room, your boss will choose 
to wait for you in the next room on the same side in the next round. So, in
order to avoid 'boss encounters', you have to switch sides every turn.

To switch sides, simply touch the widget, but be aware, the 'Escher Hallway'
is named like this for a reason. When stepping back into the hallway, there
is no telling if you have been in a left- or a rightside room. You simply
have to memorize this.

Every round you earn experience points. You gain one point for running into
your boss, three points for not running in your boss and four points on
every fifth round you manage to avoiding 'boss encounters'.
